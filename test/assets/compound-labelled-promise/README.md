# Paved Path Demo

This is an example Promise to demonstrate the implementation of Compound
Promises. It encapsulates Knative and PostgreSQL in a single Promise. Sending a
resource request will create a new Knative Serving and a new PostgreSQL instance
on the Destination.


> **Warning**
>
> **To use this Promise, the Kubernetes cluster running Kratix must be registered
as a Destination**
>
> Check out the [Compound Promises
guide](https://kratix.io/docs/main/guides/compound-promises) on the Kratix
documentation for details on how to setup your platform.
